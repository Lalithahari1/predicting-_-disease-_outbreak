🌞 Solar Power Prediction using Machine Learning 📌 Overview This project focuses on predicting solar power generation using machine learning models. It is developed as part of my internship, where I explore various techniques to enhance the accuracy of solar power forecasting.

🔍 Objectives Analyze historical solar power generation data Build predictive models using machine learning Evaluate model performance and optimize predictions 📁 Dataset The dataset includes features such as weather conditions, solar radiation, and historical power generation. These variables help train the model to forecast solar power output effectively.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Python (Jupyter Notebook) Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization Scikit-learn for machine learning models TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning models are used) 🚀 Implementation Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data Feature selection: Identifying key variables affecting power generation Model training: Implementing regression models for prediction Evaluation: Measuring performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² 📜 Results The project aims to provide an accurate model for predicting solar power output, which can assist in optimizing energy distribution and planning.

🤝 Contributions Feel free to contribute by improving the model, refining data processing techniques, or suggesting alternative approaches.

📢 Acknowledgments Special thanks to my mentors and colleagues for their guidance and support throughout this internship.
